| 1 | React web (devotee + admin) | Firebase Functions, Firestore | Low | 6 | 1.5 | 2.7 | MVP, limited geography pilots | Limited scalability, vendor lock-in |
| 2 | React + Ionic PWA, React admin | Firebase Functions, Firestore, Algolia | Low-Medium | 10 | 2.5 | 4.5 | Mobile-first validation without app stores | PWA limitations on iOS, offline cache complexity |
| 3 | React Native (devotee), React admin | Firebase + Cloud Run | Medium | 16 | 4.0 | 7.2 | Regional expansion with moderate concurrency | App store dependency, streaming costs |

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

- **Streaming Reliability (High)**: Temple bandwidth variability can undermine live experiences; require redundant ingest (SRT + WebRTC), real-time monitoring, and offline fallback recordings across all variants.
- **Regulatory Compliance (High)**: Handling donations and user data across regions introduces GDPR, RBI, and data localization obligations; embed compliance reviews in design, adopt data residency controls (GCP india-south1) and maintain audit trails.
- **Security & Privacy (High)**: Sensitive devotee data and payment flows must be protected; enforce zero-trust IAM, regular pen-tests, OWASP compliance, and security training for engineering staff.
- **Talent Availability (Medium)**: Advanced variants need experienced Kubernetes, streaming, and data engineers; mitigate via early hiring, partner augmentation, and training budgets.
- **Scope Creep (Medium)**: Extensive feature set risks timeline slippage; maintain prioritized roadmap, definition-of-done per epic, and stage-gate approvals before adding large features.
- **Budget Overrun (Medium)**: Currency fluctuations and vendor pricing can impact cost; use multi-year vendor contracts, buffer 8–12% contingency, and monthly FinOps reporting.

## Recommendations & Next Steps

1. Approve Variant 4 as the baseline implementation path to balance scalability, cost, and time-to-market while keeping roadmap optionality for Variant 5 as adoption grows.
2. Initiate a 4-week pre-project mobilization covering vendor contracting (streaming, payments, DRM), GCP organization provisioning, and hiring for critical roles (architect, SRE, streaming specialist).
3. Stand up governance: architecture board, change advisory board, security champions, and FinOps cadence to support development across the chosen variant.
4. Conduct detailed discovery workshops with temple partners and devotee personas to validate priority epics before sprint 0.
5. Establish KPIs (uptime, engagement, subscription conversion) and instrumentation blueprint to ensure data-driven decision making from the first release.
